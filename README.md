## Introduction

This repository accompanies the book **Test Smarters**, which explores:
- How Polly.js can streamline the testing and debugging of HTTP requests.
- Techniques for recording and replaying API interactions.
- Integration with popular frameworks and libraries.

Whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your testing strategy, this guide will help you understand and apply Polly.js in real-world scenarios.

## About Polly.js

Polly.js is a powerful library that intercepts HTTP requests, records the responses, and allows you to replay these interactions later. This makes it invaluable for:
- Testing front-end applications without making real network requests.
- Simulating various API response scenarios.
- Debugging network issues with ease.

In this book, we cover both basic and advanced usage of Polly.js, along with practical examples and exercises.
